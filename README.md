# Mini Linear Regression in PyTorch

## Overview
This project implements a simple **linear regression model** using PyTorch. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of training a machine learning model, including data generation, model creation, loss computation, and optimization using gradient descent.

## Features
- Uses **PyTorch** for model creation and training.
- Runs efficiently in **Google Colab**.
- Implements a **basic linear regression model**.
- Visualizes training loss.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if applicable)

## Model
1. **Data Generation** - Creates sample data for training.
2. **Model Definition** - A simple linear regression model with **one layer**.
3. **Loss Function** - Uses **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function.
4. **Optimizer** - Utilizes **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** for training.
5. **Training Loop** - Iteratively updates model weights to minimize loss.
